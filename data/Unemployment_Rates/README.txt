To obtain estimates of women worker employment, the ratio of weighted   2026-01-09       Current
women employees to the weighted all employees in the sample is assumed
to equal the same ratio in the universe. The current month's women
worker ratio, thus, is estimated and then multiplied by the
all-employee estimate. The weighted-difference-link-and-taper formula
(described in the source) is used to estimate the current month's
women worker ratio. This formula adds the change in the matched
sample's women worker ratio (the weighted-difference link) to the
prior month's estimate, which has been slightly modified to reflect
changes in the sample composition (the taper).  The series comes from

To obtain estimates of women worker employment, the ratio of weighted   2026-01-09       Current
women employees to the weighted all employees in the sample is assumed
to equal the same ratio in the universe. The current month's women
worker ratio, thus, is estimated and then multiplied by the
all-employee estimate. The weighted-difference-link-and-taper formula
(described in the source) is used to estimate the current month's
women worker ratio. This formula adds the change in the matched
sample's women worker ratio (the weighted-difference link) to the
prior month's estimate, which has been slightly modified to reflect
changes in the sample composition (the taper).  The series comes from
the 'Current Population Survey (Household Survey)'  The source code

Notes
To obtain estimates of women worker employment, the ratio of weighted   2026-01-09       Current
women employees to the weighted all employees in the sample is assumed
to equal the same ratio in the universe. The current month's women
worker ratio, thus, is estimated and then multiplied by the
all-employee estimate. The weighted-difference-link-and-taper formula
(described in the source) is used to estimate the current month's
women worker ratio. This formula adds the change in the matched
sample's women worker ratio (the weighted-difference link) to the
prior month's estimate, which has been slightly modified to reflect
changes in the sample composition (the taper).  The series comes from

Notes
To obtain estimates of women worker employment, the ratio of weighted   2026-01-09       Current
women employees to the weighted all employees in the sample is assumed
to equal the same ratio in the universe. The current month's women
worker ratio, thus, is estimated and then multiplied by the
all-employee estimate. The weighted-difference-link-and-taper formula
(described in the source) is used to estimate the current month's
women worker ratio. This formula adds the change in the matched
sample's women worker ratio (the weighted-difference link) to the
prior month's estimate, which has been slightly modified to reflect
changes in the sample composition (the taper).  The series comes from
the 'Current Population Survey (Household Survey)'  The source code
